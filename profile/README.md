## Welcome to WaterTAP ðŸ‘‹

The Water treatment Technoeconomic Assessment Platform (WaterTAP) is an open-source Python-based software package that
supports the technoeconomic assessment of full water treatment trains. Through the development of WaterTAP, we seek to
provide the broader water research community with an integrated modeling and simulation capability to consistently evaluate
cost, energy, and environmental tradeoffs across water treatment options and identify high impact opportunities for innovation
including novel materials, processes, and networks.
